# Machine Translation between Greek and Engish numbers

This is my solution for the Knowledge Systems and Technologies course at NTUA (2013-14), written in SWI-Prolog (version 6.6.1) using the [GULP 3.1](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Edianaz/2501/Parser/gulp3mod.pl) extension for UBGs.

The objective was to create a system that will automatically translate Greek numbers (in words) into English, and vice versa.

Example:

* εκατόν δύο = a hundred and two
* δεκα εννέα = nineteen
* ογδόντα = eighty
* διακόσια δώδεκα = two hundred and twelve
* τριάντα τέσσερα = thirty-four
